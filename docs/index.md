# Create new plugin

You can either use **Plugin Registration** dialog to create new plugin from a template. The dialog will create a temporary, read-only file that will have to be saved or copied into the **Scripts folder**. This is quite important, otherwise MacOS may refuse to run the script.

Downloading and modifying one of the [sample plugins](https://github.com/onflapp/TextSerPlugins) is good way to start start as well.

# Sample Plugin

...

# Where do I find the Scripts folder?

The scripts folder is under your home folder **Library/Application Scripts/com.onflapp.TextSer**

Use TextSer's Help menu or the **Plugin Registration** dialog to go to it.

If you want to use Finder directly:

- select menu “Go”, then “Go to Folder”
- type in '~/Library/Application Scripts/com.onflapp.TextSer'
- If this folder doesn’t exist already, create it.
